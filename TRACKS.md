## A Stack for Good

How can you leverage the Convergence Stack to do Good, with a capital G? In this track we invite you create your moonshot for a better world. The crazier, the better.

Focus areas: Learning, Storage, Networking, Middleware, UX

## Bringing DeFi to the IoT and AI

The Ethereum community is the most mature developer ecosystem in the decentralised space. Ethereum’s development remains vertical despite the highly versatile nature of the chain. Developers target DApps and DeFi.

The Convergence Stack offers scalable solutions to decentralised IoT coordination and AI, whether through Fetch.AI, IOTA, Sovrin or RightMesh. These protocols have complete, usable base-layer core software, but in many cases have less mature financial capabilities. Ethereum’s capacity for on-chain financial logic, particularly DeFi, is unparalleled.

The Ethereum track seeks developers who can apply DeFi and Ethereum’s rich developer tooling to the IoT and AI use cases in the Convergence Stack.

Focus areas: Learning, Middleware, UX

## ETHBerlin and the Department of Decentralization track

Middleware Community Improvement Bounty: during ETHBerlinZwei, DeFi reigned supreme. We saw incredible projects such as the mixer of mixers S.U.D.Z, Cherry Swap: swapping interest rates using the Compound Protocol, or Ratelock: fixed interest rates for lending/borrowing. The most innovative DeFi app built at Diffusion 2019 will be awarded 1.000 EUR.

UX Community Improvement Bounty: We are looking for a project that truly moves the needle when it comes to overall User Experience and usability for the eco-system. Working with a nascent technology it is necessary to address the underwhelming user experience and foster new mental models that users can easily rely upon when interfacing with the complexities of the Web 3 Technology Stack. This bounty will also be awarded 1000 EUR.

Networking Community Improvement Bounty: this is a continuation of our initiative with Protocol Labs’ Libp2p. Before ETHBerlin, we sourced feedback from developers building on Cosmos, ETH2.0, Golem and more and identified pain points that Libp2p needed to overcome for a better experience building the core networking stack for technologies such as Cosmos, Polkadot, ETH 2.0, and many others. During ETHBerlinZwei, we offered six bounties. We are continuing this great work by allocating 1000 EUR to a Libp2p improvement bounty at Diffusion 2019. The more Libp2p continues to improve, the more teams around the blockchain ecosystem are benefitted! If you would like to contribute to the bounty, the scope is here.

## The Odyssey Serendipity Network

The Challenge: Creating the infrastructure for collaborative knowledge networks where questions meet people who want to help answer those questions. An open-source, decentralised network of (curated) ecosystem nodes, where people actually want to find each other. Their stories are bright stars, bound to be connected, only to find out the connection is already there.

Since 2017, over three thousand people from all over the world have been gathering once a year in the Netherlands, in Groningen. These people are coming together for something that has become known as the Odyssey. It is a very diverse group of people, growing each year. At the third edition in 2019, 100 teams and hundreds of experts from 30 countries (1500 people in total) worked on 20 complex challenges. These challenges have a major societal or environmental impact (UN SDGs and the like) and involve many stakeholders. They simply can’t be solved by one organisation/government, industry or sector. These challenges can only be solved through grassroots, mass collaboration and these new forms of mass collaboration need digital public infrastructure, to enable anyone to contribute. In short, we are building interconnected, collaborative ecosystems for innovation. The Odyssey challenge owners, mostly corporates, governments, NGOs and scientific institutes have brought a multitude of stakeholders to the table and prepared thoroughly as the innovation program they are part of starts in September. All this preparation, as well as careful curation of all the teams and experts in Februari, culminates in a weekend in April where all parties involved are building working prototypes in only 48 hours.

We invite you to check the [Odyssey 2019 after movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q98Ry7OPYUM) and [opening story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RF9Dn4OECQ).

Anyone that has ever been at Odyssey experiences a network and serendipity effect that is unlike any other hackathon. With the Serendipity Network we want to digitise and distribute the serendipity effect of the Odyssey Hackathon experience for everyone in the world and create a network of ecosystems committed to helping each other. Where each actor and ecosystem is connected, not based on who knows whom but on who is working on what and in which context.

## Token Engineering Track

Token Engineering: (re-)invent economic mechanisms by using simulations!

Cryptoeconomic systems will allow us to establish new rules and economic incentives for blockchain ecosystems. For the first time in history we will be able to define such systems from scratch and use tokens as a programmable representation of value.

To develop such systems we can apply tools and methods from complex systems engineering. One core element are simulations that allow us to verify a specific system design before launching it to the real world. Over the last months, BlockScience developed a token modeling framework, called [cadCAD](https://medium.com/block-science/introducing-complex-adaptive-dynamics-computer-aided-design-cadcad-38b63b541eb8).

CommonsStack.org has open-sourced cadCAD at tegg.io conference in August - it is now available to everyone to [start simulating token economies](https://youtu.be/qjdjX2m_p0Q).

The TokenEngineering track seeks developers to use cadCAD to validate and improve a given cryptoeconomic building block, or create one.

In our introductory workshops you’ll learn how to design a token system from scratch, break it down to cryptoeconomic building blocks, think multiple layers of abstraction and use simulations to validate and iterate on a given module. This requires basic knowledge in Python, system dynamics, and token models.

During the hackathon, you’ll be able to apply your learnings in a design challenge. The best solution will be awarded a special Token Engineering prize.

## Machine Learning in the Decentralised World

Machine learning has taken a great flight over the past decade. The unreasonable effectiveness of data has quickly brought us to a world where machine learning is used in almost every service we use on a daily basis. In parallel, advancements in techniques like federated learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and tokenization enable us to build secure, privacy-preserving and collectively-owned machine learning.

When data has become a digital asset, how can you leverage it in your DApp? What can you achieve with machine learning with the ever growing open datasets that decentralised systems themselves produce?

Submissions in this track are required to use a form of machine learning. Privacy-preserving forms of machine learning are preferred.

Focus areas: Learning, Storage

## Shaking up the Model: Data and Compute in Different Places

The client-server model of computing has been the dominant paradigm for decades. The vast majority of data is kept in silos, and the vast majority of algorithms to deliver value from that data is run by centralised operators. With Web 3 and the Convergence Stack we have the building blocks for different models, bringing the user back in control. Peer to peer protocols, agent-based architectures and distributed ledgers have opened the door to new ways of building ecosystems unified by software. But how do we ensure data reliability and long-term durability when users own their own data, while keeping data private? How do we enable access control in decentralised systems? In your system design, what happens at the inevitable point in the future when the cryptographic algorithms break?

In this track we want to see DApps built on the Convergence Stack that use an innovative model of storing and processing data to address these questions.

## The Usable Stack

It’s been ten years since the inception of blockchain, and using crypto and DApps is still hard. Too hard for the widespread adoption it deserves. Things are getting better: there are many great initiatives to make accessing DApps easier for new users, such as Metamask, Portis, and Torus, but to an extent these are only scratching the surface of great Web 3 user experience. How do we not only lower the barrier of entry, but make every interaction that a user has with a smart contract understandable and safe? As we extend the usage of distributed ledgers from simple value transactions to elaborate smart contracts and realise an open data economy, how do we provide ways for users to interact with it, without creating new centralised gatekeepers?

In this track we want to see DApps on the Convergence Stack that use innovative ways to use the decentralised web securely. We encourage you to think beyond the browser - augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), voice interfaces (VUI), conversational interfaces (CUIs) and NFC tags are all ways to engage with a cryptosystem.

Focus areas: UX
