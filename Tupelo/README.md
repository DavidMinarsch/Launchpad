# Tupelo
## JavaScript, TypeScript, ClojureScript

Tupelo is a distributed ledger and decentralized application platform designed
for applications that need to represent the ownership of both real world and
virtual objects efficiently.

Tupelo separates data storage from trust, and this separation allows the
platform to be lightweight, fast, and flexible. Each object or asset modeled in
Tupelo gets it's own independent and isolated ledger called a ChainTree, and
applications store ChainTree data either on IPFS or any other IPLD compatible
data store.

## Get Started

The [Tupelo WASM_SDK](https://github.com/QuorumControl/tupelo-wasm-sdk) is the
easiest way to integrate a JavaScript/TypeScript/Node application with Tupelo. A
[ClojureScript wrapper](https://github.com/QuorumControl/tupelo-cljs-sdk) of the
WASM SDK is also available to more seamlessly integrate ClojureScript
applications with Tupelo.
