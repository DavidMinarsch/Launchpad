# Quorum Control
## JavaScript, TypeScript, Clojure

Quorum Control has built Tupelo, a DAG-based distributed ledger. The platform centers on lightweightness, IPFS storage, and its [WASM SDK](https://www.quorumcontrol.com/blog/2019/8/22/new-wasm-based-sdk-for-tupelo) which does not require a connection to an RPC server.
